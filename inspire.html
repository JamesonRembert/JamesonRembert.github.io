<h1>Ayden Owens Delerme </h1>
<h2>Puerto Rico </h2>
<p> Ayden Owens Delerme is someone I look up to, and someone who inspires me. Firstly, he is one of the best decathletes in the world. I myself am a decathlete who strives to reach the elite level Owens Delerme is at. Additonally, he is the youngest of the elite decathletes in the world. Finally, on the international stage he competes for Puerto Rico, representing his heritage. As a Korean-American, his choice to represent his heritage is something that really inspires me.
